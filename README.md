# CityGenerator

### This microservice will return a random city name from a text file, utilizing an Express server to listen for requests from the client.

## Instructions
#### Make sure Node is installed so that the server can be hosted.
#### Use npm install from the terminal to install necessary packages.
#### Run node .\cityServer.js to start hosting the server on port 8001.
#### Using the provided index.html file, send a request by clicking on the 'City' button.
#### Clicking on the 'City' button will be sending an xhr GET request to localhost:8001.

#### The microservice will receive a GET request from the client and read the text file.
#### The response from the server will include only a single city from the text file.
#### To edit how the client receives the response from the server, change the code in cityRequest.js and handle the xhr.response differently.
